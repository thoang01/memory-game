# Memory Game API

---

## Description

<p>This <b>Memory Game API</b> is a fun personal project using JavaScript, ReactJS, built-in + custom hooks, Fetch and many more!</p>

<p>This process involved using env variables, headers and requesting an API KEY.</p>

<p>I focused on passing props, ensuring they are the right ones by using propTypes, and created 2 custom hooks to retrieve data and give game logic from the API. I also digged a bit more into how the reactivity works using useEffect + useState and divided tasks to different components for easier to read code.</p>
